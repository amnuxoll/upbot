~/upbot/demo/README

This file contains three binaries, brainstem_xx_xx_xx.out,
stop_xx_xx_xx.out and client_xx_xx_xx.out, where the x's indicate
build date.  These three files have been sequestered into this directory
for the sole purpose of quickly demonstrating the upbot testbed code.

To execute the demo:

1. Place brainstem.out on the gumstix using scp.

2. Place stop.out on the gumstix using scp.  This is nice to have on
hand in case the roomba gets confused and starts ramming things
uncontrollably.

3. Execute brainstem.out from the gumstix using ssh.

$ ./brainstem.out &

4. Execute client.out from the development desktop.  It requires the
IP address of the gumstix.

$ ./client.out 10.81.3.48

5. From the client, issue commands to the roomba:

w - forward
a - left
d - right
x - backwards
s - stop
