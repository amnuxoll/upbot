 * There are multiple types of services executing on the system that

 * UPBOT system.
 *
 * For now, there are only two services planned for UPBOT, so
 * everything is piled into this file for now.  If there are ever more
 * services, or the services get more complicated, it may be
 * worthwhile to break up this file into pieces.

// ************************************************************************
//
// DATA SERVICE.  The data service accepts sensor data collected by
// the robots in the physical world and delivers the data to other
// software entities, e.g. the system supervisor.
// 
// The data service is implemented in two halves.  
// 
// a. The Collector.  The data service collector collects sensor data
// locally at a given sensor data collection point, i.e., a robot.
// The Collector is responsible for forwarding data to a collator.
//
// b. The Collator.  The data service collator is a repository for one
// or many sensor data collectors.  It also allows entities to
// subscribe to sensor data.
// 
// ************************************************************************

/**
 * dsCreateCollector
 *
 * The Collector half of the data service collects sensor data locally
 * at a given robot.  If specified by the connectRemote parameter, it
 * also connects to a remote data collator service to whom the locally
 * collected data will be reported.  Use constant values
 * SERV_CONNECT_REMOTE or SERV_NO_CONNECT to indicate whether or not
 * to make this remote connection.
 * 
 * Upon calling dsCreateCollector, it is possible that the operating
 * system may not have the resources necessary for the caller to
 * communicate locally with this service.  If so, the function returns
 * SERV_LOCAL_FAILURE (-1) to indicate an error.
 *
 * Upon calling dsCreateCollector, it is possible that the operating
 * system may not have the resources necessary to communicate remotely
 * with its data collator service.  If so, the function returns
 * SERV_REMOTE_FAILURE to indicate an error.
 *
 * Upon calling dsCreateCollector, it is possible that no initial
 * connection may be established with the remote service.  Based on
 * the value of the parameter continueLocally, dsCreateCollector will
 * either:
 *
 *  i) SERV_NO_REMOTE_CONTINUE: create a working local service that
 *  will make subsequent attempts to connect to the remote service,
 *  though no guarantee is made on the success of these attempts.
 * 
 *  ii) SERV_NO_REMOTE_FAIL: no local service is created in the
 *  absence of the remote connection.
 *
 * In either case, the function will return SERV_NO_CONNECTION if no
 * remote connection was established.
 * 
 * The parameter, sh, must exist.  If sh is NULL, then we do not have a
 * well-formed service handler and the function returns SERV_NULL_SH
 * (-3) to indicate an error.
 *
 * @param[in] connectRemote a boolean value indicating whether or not
 * this local data collector should establish a connection with a
 * remote data collator service.
 * 
 * @param[out] sh the serviceHandler to be populated by this
 * dsCreateCollector call.  This serviceHandler is how the caller make
 * subsequent accesses of the service.
 * 
 * @returns an integer value indicating success or failure of the
 * dsCreateCollector call.
