This directory contains interface designs for the next generation of
UPBOT.  The code and documentation in this directory attempts to answer
some of the following design decisions:

1. What is an appropriate abstraction of a robot, from the perspective
of software?

2. What are the data types necessary to proxy a robot in software?

3. What is the interface between a robot proxy and the local software?

4. What is the architecture of the local software controlling the
robot via the robot proxy?

5. What is the interface between the local software and the remote
system?
